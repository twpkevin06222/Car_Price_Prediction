# SectionA
This folder contains the source code for Datium Data Science Test Section A.  
For ease of visualisation, the Juptery NoteBook is split into two parts.  

--- 
## Part 1
- `Part01_EDA.ipynb` documents the codeblocks for data preparation, which incldues data understanding and data preprocessing.   
## Part 2
- `Part02_model_and_evaluation.ipynb` formulates the documents for model training and evaluation.  

---
`utils.py` contains helper functions that is useful during the implementation.

Download dependencies  
`$ pip install --r requirements.txt`

There are two files not provided in the repo due to privacy issue:  
- `DatiumSample.rpt` is not included due to privacy issue.  
- `dummies_ds.csv` file can be generated from `Part01_EDA.ipynb` which will be used in `Part02_model_and_evaluation.ipynb`.

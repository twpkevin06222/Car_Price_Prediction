This folder contains the source code for Datium Data Science Test Section A.  
For ease of visualisation, the Juptery NoteBook is split into two parts.  

--- 
## Part 1
- `Part01_EDA.ipynb` documents the codeblocks for data preparation, which incldues data understanding and data preprocessing.   
## Part 2
- `Part02_model_and_evaluation.ipynb` formulates the documents for model training and evaluation.
